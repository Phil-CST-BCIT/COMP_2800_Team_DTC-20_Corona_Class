## Repo Organization

The server .js file (app.js), favicon, package.json and package-lock.json files are directly contained inside the root directory. All server-side Javascript should be added to app.js. Any CSS styling files should be created in the public/css folder. Any client-side or middleware Javascript files should be created in the public/js folder. Any image files should be added to public/css/images. Any .ejs files should be created in the views/pages folder. As of currently, this project uses only .ejs pages, any .html files are converted to .ejs. A subfolder can be created in its appropriate parent folder if nultiple files of the same type are closely related (e.g. user folder for create.ejs and login.ejs).
